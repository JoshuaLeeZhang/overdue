# Overdue

**An autonomous academic web agent** that reduces student stress by automating the assignments that are wastes of time. It runs in the background: monitoring coursework, reminding you about deadlines, auto-completing busywork, and reviewing your submissions against rubrics so nothing slips.

Unlike traditional productivity tools that require constant manual checking, Overdue operates **proactively**. It functions like a digital executive assistant: it observes incoming academic responsibilities, evaluates urgency and complexity, and organizes work into a clear execution pipeline. Let the AI handle the stupid assignments so you can focus on what actually matters.

## How It Works

1. **Ingest** — Assignment data enters the system via authorized integrations, structured imports, or user-provided inputs.

2. **Analyze** — A prioritization engine evaluates each task using deadlines, estimated workload, difficulty, and scheduling constraints.

3. **Plan** — The agent builds a dynamic execution plan that updates in real time as conditions change.

4. **Execute** — Work is processed asynchronously in the background. The agent **auto-completes** assignments (especially the tedious ones), and **reviews work you’ve submitted** to ensure it follows rubrics before or after you turn it in.

5. **Present** — A visual pipeline interface shows tasks in states such as *queued*, *processing*, and *completed*, so you always see what the agent is working on and what needs your attention.

## Key Features

- **Proactive monitoring & reminders** — Tracks coursework and deadlines and reminds you so you never miss an assignment.

- **Auto-complete assignments** — Automates the tedious, time-wasting assignments in the background so work is done before deadlines.

- **Rubric review** — Reviews work you’ve submitted against assignment rubrics to ensure it meets requirements before or after you turn it in.

- **Smart prioritization** — Considers deadlines, workload, difficulty, and constraints to order and schedule work.

- **Asynchronous processing** — Schedules work in the background and delivers results when they’re needed.

- **Urgency response mode** — When a deadline approaches, the agent reprioritizes, compresses schedules, and generates a focused action plan to finish in time.

- **Pipeline transparency** — A clear view of queued, in-progress, and completed work so you always know what the AI is doing.

## Vision

Overdue rethinks how students interact with academic responsibilities. Instead of reacting to deadlines and grinding through busywork, you get an AI that:

- **Reminds you** what’s due and when  
- **Automates** the assignments that are wastes of time  
- **Reviews** your submissions against rubrics so you don’t lose points on technicalities  

Less time on stupid assignments, fewer surprises, better alignment with what instructors actually want.

## Technical Concepts

The project integrates several advanced ideas in one system:

- **Autonomous agents** — Background behavior that observes, decides, and acts without constant user input.  
- **Workflow orchestration** — Coordinating multi-step processes and state transitions.  
- **Task prioritization** — Algorithms that weigh deadlines, effort, and constraints.  
- **Asynchronous processing pipelines** — Non-blocking, scheduled execution.  
- **Human–AI collaboration** — Interfaces that make the agent’s state and outputs visible and actionable.

## Summary

**Overdue** is an autonomous academic co-pilot: a background AI that reminds you about assignments, auto-completes the tedious ones, and reviews your submissions against rubrics so you stop wasting time on busywork.
